# Background Remover
This Python script allows you to easily remove the background from images using the `rembg` library. By providing an image file, the script processes the image and outputs a new image with the background removed.

## Installation
To use this Background Remover, you need to have `Python` installed on your machine along with the `rembg` library. You can install the necessary library using `pip`.

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sleinkaraman/BackgroundRemover.git
cd BackgroundRemover
```

2. Install the required library:
```
pip install rembg
```

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing the Python file:
```
python BackgroundRemover.py
```

2. Enter the name of the file you want to process from your computer and the name you want to save the new image as. For example, if you have an image named `animal.jpg` and you want to save the output as `output.png`, you can specify these names in the `BackgroundRemover.py` file.


3. The script will process the specified file and save the result with the name you provided.
